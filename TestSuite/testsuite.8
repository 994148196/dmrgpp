.SH NAME
testsuite.pl \- Systematically run tests for DMRG++ 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ./testsuite.pl 
[\-a|\-\-all] [\-n int] [\-l int] [\-r] [\-v] [\-m] [\-f] [\-u]
.SH DESCRIPTION
If a test number is not given to testsuite.pl, it will display a list of available tests and ask which test to run. The command will create
a driver program, a Makefile, and it will build DMRG++ and run it. Followed by interpretation of the results and comparisons using precomputed results. At any given time, the user can escape the testsuite.pl execution by pressing Control+C.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-a,\-\-all
Runs all available tests sequentially.
.TP
.B \-n=test num
If test number is non-negative, runs the test with the given number.
If test number is negative, runs all tests starting from test number to the end
.B (or until limit test number).
.TP
.B \-l=limit test num
Specificies the last test to run when running multiple tests sequentially. Applied when using the
.B \-\-all
option or given a
.B negative test number.
.TP
.B \-r remove
When set all temporary files created during test configuration, compilation, and execution of DMRG++.
.TP
.B \-v verbose
Displays messages created during test selection, configuration, compilation, and execution of DMRG++. Descriptions of all tests are found in
.B inputs/descriptions.txt.
.TP
.B \-m manual config
Provides the functionality for the user to manually enter configuration parameters prior to test compilation and execution. Auto configuration is the default setting.
.TP
.B \-f force
Runs the configuration and compilation processes even though they had already been made previously and valid executables exist for that test number.
.TP
.B \-u update
Synchronizes and updates the hash table in 
.B hashTable.txt
with the existing executables in the 
.B src/
directory.
.SH FILE ASSOCIATIONS
Each test has a file associated with it
.B (inputs/processing#.txt)
which specifies the types of analyses to be done for that test. The implementation of each analysis is denoted with a custom meta language in
.B inputs/processingLibrary.txt.
This implementation of the test suite allows for scalability by adding new analyses to the processing library and connecting them with new subroutines in testsuite.pl.

G.A. & E.P.
.SH BUGS
User has to enter configuration parameters for every executable of the same test if manual configuration is selected.
Needs improvement in exception handling procedure.
.SH LIMITATIONS
Currently, testsuite.pl does not support MPI tests, or pthread
tests. Also, a lot of DMRG++ functionality needs corresponding tests
in the testsuite. This will be added eventually.
