Synopsis:
To Build DMRG++:
cd src
perl configure.pl
(please answer questions regarding model, etc)
make

To Run DMRG++:
./dmrg input.inp


Required Software:
1) GNU C++
2) The LAPACK library.
This library is available for most platforms.
The configure.pl script will ask for the LDFLAGS variable 
to pass to the compiler/linker. If the linux platform was
chosen the default/suggested LDFLAGS will include -llapack.
If the osx platform was chosen the default/suggested LDFLAGS will
include  -framework Accelerate.
For other platforms the appropriate linker flags must be given.
More information on LAPACK is here: http://netlib.org/lapack/

Optional Software:
3) make or gmake (only needed to use the Makefile)
4) perl (only needed to run the configure.pl script)
