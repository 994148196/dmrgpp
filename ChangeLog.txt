2017-06-15 Version 4.50

* Standalone input label DenseSparseThreshold

* DensityMatrix: Returns BlockDiagonalMatrix

* KronUtil: more function in same compilation unit
  to improve inlining

* MatrixDenseOrSparse.h now in KronUtil

* linker time optimizations for gcc

2017-06-08 Version 4.48

* DenseSparseThreshold label

* useSvd supports vectorwithoffsets

2017-05-25 Version 4.46

* useSvd (but not yet for vectorWithOffsets or
  more than 1 target)

* useSvd pthreads

* Lanczos: saves LanczosVectors by the default
    
    Internally lotaMemory=true is the default
    prefix + NoSaveLanczosVectors=1
    should be used to have Lanczos not save vectors

2017-05-18 Version 4.44

* bug fix in printing

* changes in preparation for useSvd option

* Kron: KronNoLoadBalance SolverOptions added

* PTHREAD_ASSIGN_AFFINITIES removed, now a runtime option

* KronUtil: supports useComplex

2017-05-11 Version 4.42

* extendedPrint SolverOptions added

* SolverOptions useSvd added, but not working yet

* SuperExtendedHubbard1Orb: includes spin orbit

* configure.pl does not generate sources
  by default anymore. All DmrgDriver*.cpp files
  are now commited

2017-05-04 Version 4.40

* Kron:

	- bug fix for fermion sign
	- changes to KronUtil
	- KronUtil Makefile created by configure.pl
	- does not support SU(2)
	- weights for load balancing

* MatrixDenseOrSparse: 50% cutoff

* PsiApp used by dmrg and observe drivers

* observe: compilation in parallel

* option printmatrix

* ci: -nosu2 option added


2017-04-24 Version 4.38

* ci: -S option allows to run on command line
      or batch

* Makefile: -lblas -llapack

* announce when ifdef OPERATORS_CHANGE_ALL

* Kron and KronUtil:
	- additional checks
	- bug fix in offsets
	- bug fix for in and out vectors
	- bug fix in estimate_kron_cost
