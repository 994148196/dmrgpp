clean WFT

ObserverHelper must have only one constructor

eliminate Basis::electrons(...) and use FermionSign instead

observer must be able to tell if main run was done with reals or complex

place save(...) functions next to "load" ctors.

string name for basis objects

json format for input?

create test for non-constant hoppings --> done, test 26

DensityMatrixSu2 needs optimization

SU(2) + WFT is broookeeeeeen!!

TestSuite: need to eliminate hashtable.txt usage

GeometryFactory: needs to become a real factory (following Modern C++ Design)
