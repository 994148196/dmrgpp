BUGS:

SU(2) + WFT is broookeeeeeen!! (issued posted on github)

observer: fails if lattice has less than 6 sites.

observer: backwards move give wrong results for fermionic ops.

observer: backwards move does not compute edges

CLEANUPS:

WFT needs to be disabled if lattice has less than 6 sites.

eliminate Basis::electrons(...) and use FermionSign instead

observer must be able to tell if main run was done with reals or complex

place save(...) functions next to "load" ctors.

string name for basis objects

json format for input?

DensityMatrixSu2 needs optimization

TestSuite: need to eliminate hashtable.txt usage

lanczos.cpp needs to be built by configure.pl --> move to new repository?

observer need full spin correlations S_i S_j, where S is the full spin

drivers: need virtual inheritance to simplify code.

DDMRG needs debugging,--> actually it needs rewriting :-(

FourPoint needs optimization/parallelization
