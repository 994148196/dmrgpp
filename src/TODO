BUGS:

SU(2) + WFT is broookeeeeeen!! (issued posted on github)

observer: need to fix fermion sign for corner case 
	(i.e. correlations with last point)


CLEANUPS:

clean WFT--> actually we need two WFTs, one for Local Symm. and one for SU(2)

ObserverHelper must have only one constructor

eliminate Basis::electrons(...) and use FermionSign instead

observer must be able to tell if main run was done with reals or complex

place save(...) functions next to "load" ctors.

string name for basis objects

json format for input?

DensityMatrixSu2 needs optimization


TestSuite: need to eliminate hashtable.txt usage

lanczos.cpp needs to be built by configure.pl

tstSTruct is doing tDMRG and DDMRG, there should be two of these, 
and we need to add scaffolding to select among them.

observer need full spin correlations S_i S_j, where S is the full spin

drivers: need virtual inheritance to simply code.
