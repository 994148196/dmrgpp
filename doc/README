QUESTIONS ABOUT DMRG++ DOCUMENTATION:

Where's manual.tex now?
When one runs make under dmrgpp/src it should be created automatically.
If not, one needs to run make in this directory, that is, in dmrgpp/doc.

What does one needs in order to generate manual.tex?
PsimagDoc, which is included in PsimagLite.

What is PsimagDoc?
See PsimagDoc/README in the PsimagLite distribution.
