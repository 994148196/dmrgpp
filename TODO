BUGS:

SU(2) + WFT is broookeeeeeen!! (issued posted on github)

observer: fails if lattice has less than 6 sites.

observer: backwards move give wrong results for fermionic ops.

CLEANUPS:

WFT needs to be disabled if lattice has less than 6 sites.

eliminate Basis::electrons(...) and use FermionSign instead

observer must be able to tell if main run was done with reals or complex

place save(...) functions next to "load" ctors.

string name for basis objects

json format for input?

DensityMatrixSu2 needs optimization

DynamicDMRG needs debugging,--> actually it needs rewriting :-( <-- now under testing

FourPoint needs optimization/parallelization

finite loops aren't checked if checkpoint is an option

unused stuff gets saved in data file

cannot go backwards from infinite loop when WFT is in use
(see WaveFunctionTransfFactory.h line 137)

basis.eq(...) could be uninitialized due to quantumNumbersOld_
being uninitialized. Also true for other private data of BasisImplementation, need to fix

IoSimple needs to be completely replaced by InputNg (issue 5 on github)

Route all options.find("whatever")!=std::string::npos through the inputCheck
Problem is not everyone has inputCheck, it'd need to be connected by the ParametersDmrgSolver object.

Add guard code for singletons.
